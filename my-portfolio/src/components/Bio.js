                (What I do and why I do it aka Personal Mission Statement)
                My full name is Rose Landroche and I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I have years of experience
                in customer facing industries like retail, and customer service. I chose to change my career path
                because I love to create things, and I love a challenge. Programming is something that combines
                several of my passions, and can be used in countless industries that I want to be a part of.
